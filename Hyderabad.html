                <h2>About The City</h2>
                <p>

                    Hyderabad is the capital of southern India's Telangana state. A major center for the technology
                    industry, it's home to many upscale restaurants and shops. Popular for it’s historic sites,it is
                    situated on the Deccan Plateau along the banks of the Musi River, in the northern part of South
                    India. With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain
                    around artificial lakes, including the Hussain Sagar lake, predating the city's founding, in the
                    north of the city centre. Hyderabad is the fourth-most populous city in India with a population of
                    6.9 million residents within the city limits.
                    <br>
                    The tourism industry forms an important role in the economy of Hyderabad. It is also known as city
                    of pearls or city of Nizams. The people of Hyderabad are called Hyderabadis. Hyderabad was founded
                    in 1591 AD by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah on the banks of river Musi.

                <h2>Places to Visit</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>Charminar</h2><br>
                <div class="photo"><img src="photos/charminar.jpg" width="1000px" height="700px" ALIGN="center"><br><br></div>
                <p>
                    The first tourist attraction that comes to mind when you think of Hyderabad is Charminar, which is
                    located in the heart of the city. Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah constructed this monument in the year
                    1591.
                    The architecture of Charminar reflects Cazia style. The idea behind constructing the monument was to
                    ward off deadly epidemic, which claimed many lives during that period. The four minarets are 48.7
                    meter
                    tall. There is a mosque and 45 prayer spaces inside Charminar. Do not get discouraged by the crowd
                    there
                    if you want to have a feel of the old city and its culture.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2>Golconda Fort</h2><br>
                <div class="photo"><img src="photos/Golconda-Fort.jpg" width="1000px" height="700px" ALIGN="center"><br><br></div>

                <p>
                    A place you cannot afford to miss during your tour of Hyderabad. The name Golconda finds its root in
                    “Golla Konda”, which means Shepherd's Hill. The fort was originally constructed during the period of
                    Yadava Dynasty The Golconda fort dates back to 13th century. The acoustics effects are excellent in
                    the
                    fort. If you clap your hands at Fateh Darwaza, the sound can be clearly heard at Bala Hissar, which
                    is
                    located a kilometer away. The royal palaces and whispering walls are some of its main attractions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Ramoji Film City</h2><br>
                <div class="photo"><img src="photos/ramojifimlcity.jpg" width="1000px" height="700px" ALIGN="center"><br><br></div>

                <p>
                    Ramoji Film City has the Guinness Book Record of being the world's largest film studio. The lavish
                    gardens and open spaces have been featured in many Indian films, the most recent example being
                    Bahubali,
                    which was shot extensively here. A tour of this film city is an experience on its own and therefore,
                    Ramoji Film City is one of Hyderabad's main attraction.
                </p>
                <br>

                    Hyderabad has a warmer climate and hence cooler months, i.e. October to March are considered ideal
                    to visit the city. While the summer days are rather uncomfortable, the nights tend to be more
                    pleasant. The rising mercury levels and humidity make it very challenging to go for outdoor
                    activities. So, summer isn’t the best time to visit Hyderabad for typical touristy purposes.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Rice is a staple crop.

                    You can't talk about biryanis without mentioning the Hyderabadi Biryani. Cooked with either mutton
                    or
                    chicken, and laced with rich ingredients, this recipe is the stairway to heaven. Believe it or not,
                    this
                    dish is such a favourite that people don't mind having it for breakfast, lunch or dinner!

                    Some other must taste dishes include dosa, haleem, keema samosa, marag, kebabs and the list goes on
                    and
                    on.
