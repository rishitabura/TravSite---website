                        Dedicated to Swami Vivekananda, a religious reformer, the Vivekananda Rock Memorial is one of
                        the
                        most popular tourist attraction in Kanyakumari. Covering an area of six acres, the rock memorial
                        is
                        situated at an island a few metres into the sea and positioned at a level of 17 metres above the
                        sea
                        level. A meditation hall (Dhyana Mandapam) is also attached to the memorial for visitors to
                        meditate. The design of the mandapa incorporates different styles of temple architecture from
                        all
                        over India. It houses a statue of Vivekananda.[18] The rocks are surrounded by the Laccadive
                        Sea.

                        ft)
                        rock that represents the 38 chapters of "virtue" in the Thirukkural. The statue standing on the
                        rock
                        represents "wealth" and "pleasures", signifying that wealth and love be earned and enjoyed on
                        the
                        foundation of solid virtue.[15] The combined height of the statue and pedestal is 133 ft (40.5

                        denoting the 133 chapters in the Thirukkural. During maintenance work, as well as during rough

                        before immersion. Resembling central Indian Hindu temples in form, the memorial was designed in
                        a
                        way that on Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, the first rays of the sun fall on the exact place
                        where
                        his ashes were kept.
