                        <p>Bangalore palace is located within 200 kms from the city and is a great place to spend time.
                            Originally owned by Rev. J. Garrett, the Bangalore Palace is one of the best historical
                            places to see. The interiors of this palace speak for itself. There is a grand ballroom to
                            hold private parties. The ground floor has an exposed courtyard with granite seats enclosed
                            in fluorescent blue porcelain tiles. The walls of the fort are designed with
                            nineteenth-century Dutch and Greek paintings.</p>

                            Rice is a staple crop.<br>
                            Halbai is an exotic and a unique delicacy loved by all.
                            Idlis, Vadas, and Dosas. Ask any South Indian what would be their ideal breakfast and
                            they'll probably say dosa or idli and vada.
                            Mangalore Buns and Obbattu are a must try too.
