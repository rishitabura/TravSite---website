                <p>Saras Baug is a spectacular garden that is spread over 25 acres of land in the beautiful city of Pune, Maharashtra. Described by many as a heaven for nature lovers, the garden is a popular attraction for both locals and tourists alike. 
                The area where Saras Baug stands today was once a small lake, which dried up and was converted into the picturesque garden that it is today. Saras Baug’s main attraction is the Talyatla Ganpati Temple, built by the Peshwas in the middle of the lake in the year 1750. In addition to the temple, the beautifully manicured lawns with lush green plantations and gorgeous flowers make this place a great picnic spot for families.</p>
